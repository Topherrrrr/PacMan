# Pacman
A fun project that creates PacMen in Javascript and bounces them around in the window. Click "Add Pacman" to add in a Pacman. Keep clicking "Start Game" to send them flying! Future improvements include adding a looping animation and rotating the image once it switches directions. Feel free to use in your own projects
